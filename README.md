This is my solution for the coding challenge.

### Features

1. The app is developed using the **MVVM** structure.
2. It acheives the 2 given tasks -
    a. Displaying a list of deserts
    b. Show details about each meal including meal name, instruction and ingredients
3. Uses the two necessary endpoints to accomplish the tasks.
4. Filters nil values for API responses.
5. Takes into account basic app design principles.

### Steps to run

1. Clone the repository in Xcode.
2. Build the project and wait for the it to succeed.
3. Hit run in Xcode.

### App walkthrough

1. On running the app the first main screen shows the list of meals in the desert category and this list is **sorted** alphabetically.
2. Clicking on any of the meal takes you to the detailed view of the meal. Here you get some more information about the meal such as its name, area it is from and its tags. Additionally you also get the option to view **ingredients** and **instructions** for the meal.
3. Clicking on the ingredients displays a list of all the necessary ingredients and similar behavior is implemented for instructions.
